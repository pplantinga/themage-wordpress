This theme is a lightweight, responsive, accessible, extendable, future-friendly theme.

== Description ==

Themage aims to be a stylish, fun theme while maintaining all the good parts of blander themes.

* There is not much code, for easier extensibility and faster load times.
* The theme looks good on screens of any size.
* The markup is modern, using html5 and css3 for accessibility, and future-friendlyness.
* The theme aims to be completely accessible, even making up for some of WordPress' shortcomings.
* There are four regions you can place widgets: left sidebar, right sidebar, header, and footer.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `themage` to the `/wp-content/themes/` directory
1. Activate the theme through the 'Theme' menu in WordPress
1. If you want to keep the default background, you'll need to allow svg's (usually done with .htaccess)
